Run MMD to create misprediction explanation with rule induction(MMD) without disjunctions...
Best ruleset with most influential features and rule induction(MMD) without disjunctions:

ejection_fraction <= 30 and serum_sodium <= 137 and creatinine_phosphokinase > 99 and creatinine_phosphokinase <= 244
