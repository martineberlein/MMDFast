Run MMD to create misprediction explanation with rule induction(MMD) without disjunctions...
Best ruleset with most influential features and rule induction(MMD) without disjunctions:

ejection_fraction <= 30 and creatinine_phosphokinase <= 244 and creatinine_phosphokinase > 99

Specificity: 0.957 Precision: 0.75 Recall: 0.45
