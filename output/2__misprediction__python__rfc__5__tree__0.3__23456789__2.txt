Check which test inputs are mispredicted by the model...
Learn most influential input features...
Train random forest classifier on misprediction data...
Use feature importance to explain model...
Most influential features:
['line_removed', 'file_modified', 'line_added', 'commit_num', 'parallel_changed_file_num']
Build new input dataframe with relevant features...
Create misprediction explanation by learning decision trees...
Best ruleset with most influential features and decision trees without disjunctions:

parallel_changed_file_num > 0.5 and parallel_changed_file_num > 1.5
