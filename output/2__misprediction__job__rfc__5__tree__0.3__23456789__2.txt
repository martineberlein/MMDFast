Loading model from .joblib...
Check which test inputs are mispredicted by the model...
Learn most influential input features...
Train random forest classifier on misprediction data...
Use feature importance to explain model...
Most influential features:
['company_size_unknown', 'last_new_job', 'experience', 'city_development_index', 'training_hours']
Build new input dataframe with relevant features...
Create misprediction explanation by learning decision trees...
Best ruleset with most influential features and decision trees without disjunctions:

city_development_index <= 0.665 and training_hours <= 323.0

Specificity: 0.876 Precision: 0.472 Recall: 0.384
