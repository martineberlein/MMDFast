Loading model from .joblib...
Check which test inputs are mispredicted by the model...
Learn most influential input features...
Train random forest classifier on misprediction data...
Use feature importance to explain model...
Most influential features:
['day_of_week', 'age', 'euribor3m', 'duration']
Build new input dataframe with relevant features...
Run MMD to create misprediction explanation with rule induction(MMD) without disjunctions...
Best ruleset with most influential features and rule induction(MMD) without disjunctions:
