Check which test inputs are mispredicted by the model...
Learn most influential input features...
Train random forest classifier on misprediction data...
Use feature importance to explain model...
Most influential features:
['line_added', 'line_removed', 'commit_num', 'parallel_changed_file_num']
Build new input dataframe with relevant features...
Run MMD to create misprediction explanation with rule induction(MMD) without disjunctions...
Best ruleset with most influential features and rule induction(MMD) without disjunctions:
