Check which test inputs are mispredicted by the model...
Learn most influential input features...
Train random forest classifier on misprediction data...
Use feature importance to explain model...
Most influential features:
['duration', 'commit_num', 'file_modified', 'line_added', 'line_removed', 'parallel_changed_file_num']
