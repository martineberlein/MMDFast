Train random forest classifier on misprediction data...
Use feature importance to explain model...
Most influential features:
['campaign', 'day_of_week', 'age', 'euribor3m', 'duration']
Build new input dataframe with relevant features...
Run MMD to create misprediction explanation with rule induction(MMD) without disjunctions...
Best ruleset with most influential features and rule induction(MMD) without disjunctions:
