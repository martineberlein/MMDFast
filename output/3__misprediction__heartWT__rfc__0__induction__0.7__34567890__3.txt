Run MMD to create misprediction explanation with rule induction(MMD) without disjunctions...
Best ruleset with all features and rule induction(MMD) without disjunctions:

serum_sodium <= 137 and creatinine_phosphokinase <= 244 and ejection_fraction <= 30 and creatinine_phosphokinase > 99

Specificity: 0.986 Precision: 0.9 Recall: 0.45
